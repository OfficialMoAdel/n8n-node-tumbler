# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a comprehensive Tumblr integration for the n8n workflow automation platform. The integration will enable users to automate content creation, management, and data retrieval workflows with Tumblr's social media platform using the tumblr.js npm package and Tumblr API v2.

The integration will provide n8n users with the ability to authenticate with Tumblr, manage posts across different content types, handle blog operations, and automate social media workflows. This addresses the current gap in n8n's social media automation capabilities for the Tumblr platform.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures Tumblr credentials THEN the system SHALL implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow with PKCE
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL securely store access tokens using n8n's credential management
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them without user intervention
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
5. WHEN multiple Tumblr accounts are configured THEN the system SHALL support account selection per workflow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blogger, I want to create different types of posts (text, photo, quote, link, chat, video, audio) through n8n workflows, so that I can automate my content publishing across various formats.

5. IF post operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with suggested actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a marketing professional, I want to schedule posts using Tumblr's queue system through n8n, so that I can execute coordinated campaigns with precise timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding posts to queue THEN the system SHALL accept scheduling parameters and queue position
2. WHEN retrieving queue THEN the system SHALL return all queued posts with scheduling information
3. WHEN modifying queue THEN the system SHALL allow reordering, editing, and deletion of queued posts

2. WHEN rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide timeout handling and connection retry logic
4. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and provide specific field-level errors
5. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL log relevant details for monitoring and debugging
